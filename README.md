# simple-authentication-project
* For a long time I was interested in some of the aspects of account management and authentication systems of many big websites including how multi-factor authentication methods work etc. This is my first real attempt at trying to recreate some of the easier and simpler aspects of these systems such as: Log-in, Log-out, E-Mail Verification, Auth Tokens, Securely Storing user credentials using encryption and decryption...
* Throughout making parts of this project, I learned many things about sending E-mails programmatically, practiced my SQL knowledge and started learning small bits of JavaScript.
* NOTE: this is nowhere near production level quality and there are some obvious key aspects of user authentication still missing. This project was mainly a way for me to practice my programming and learn new things through things that interest me such as user authentication.

# Here is an image showcasing some of the plans and my thought process of how things could work before starting this project
